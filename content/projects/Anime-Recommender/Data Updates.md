# Data Management

If your data is updated every three months, you can handle this in LlamaIndex by re-indexing your data. Here's a high-level overview of how you might do this:

1. **Load New Data**: Load the new data from your data source. This could be a CSV file, a Parquet file, a database, or any other source.

2. **Compute Embeddings**: Use your language model to compute the embeddings of the anime descriptions in the new data.

3. **Update the Index**: Add the new data to the LlamaIndex. If an anime already exists in the index (based on some unique identifier like an ID or name), update its entry with the new data. Otherwise, add a new entry for the anime.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement this in code:

    ```python
    def update_index(self, new_data_path):
        # Load the new data
        new_data = self.load_data(new_data_path)

        for anime in new_data:
            # Compute the embedding of the anime description
            embedding = self.language_model.encode(anime.description)

            # If the anime already exists in the index, update its entry
            if self.index.exists(anime.id):
                self.index.update(anime.id, embedding, anime.categorical_features)
            # Otherwise, add a new entry for the anime
            else:
                self.index.add(anime.id, embedding, anime.categorical_features)
    ````

Please note that this is a basic example. You’ll need to modify it according to your specific requirements and the actual structure of your data. Also, remember to handle exceptions and edge cases in your code to make it robust and reliable.

## Record Management

Record management is a crucial aspect of any data-driven system. It helps keep track of when and what data was added or updated in the system. Although LlamaIndex does not provide built-in record management features, you can implement your own system based on your needs.

### Simple Record Management

For a simple record management system, you could keep a log file where each line records an operation on the index. Here's an example of what each line in the log file might look like:

    ```code
    2024-03-01 12:34:56, ADD, anime123, “Anime 123 description” 
    2024-03-01 12:35:07, UPDATE, anime456, “Updated Anime 456 description”
    ```

Each line contains a timestamp, the operation (ADD or UPDATE), the ID of the anime, and the new description of the anime.

## Advanced Record Management

For a more advanced record management system, you could use a separate database to keep track of the operations. This would allow you to run complex queries on your records and could be more efficient if you have a large number of operations.

Here's an example of how you might structure your database:

| Timestamp           | Operation | Anime ID | Description                   |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 2024-03-01 12:34:56 | ADD       | anime123 | "Anime 123 description"       |
| 2024-03-01 12:35:07 | UPDATE    | anime456 | "Updated Anime 456 description" |

Each row in the database represents an operation on the index.

Remember, the choice between a simple and advanced record management system depends on your specific needs and the scale of your project.
