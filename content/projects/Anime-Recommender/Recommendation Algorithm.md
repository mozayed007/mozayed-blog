# Anime Recommendation Algorithm

This document outlines the design of an anime recommendation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity and content-based filtering. The algorithm uses LlamaIndex for semantic similarity computations and a vector database for efficient similarity search.

## 1. Preprocessing

The first step is to clean and preprocess the anime synopsis data. This might involve removing stop words, stemming, and tokenization.

```python
def preprocess(synopses):
    # Implement your preprocessing steps here
    return preprocessed_synopses
```

## 2. Vectorization

Next, we use a language model (like BERT, Word2Vec, or FastText) to convert the preprocessed synopsis into vector representations. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the synopsis.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
synopsis_vectors = model.encode(preprocessed_synopses)
```

## 3. Semantic Similarity with LlamaIndex

We use LlamaIndex’s SemanticSimilarityEvaluator to compute the semantic similarity between the query anime’s synopsis and all other anime synopses. This will give you a list of animes that are semantically similar to the query anime based on their synopses.

```python
from llama_index.core.evaluation import SemanticSimilarityEvaluator

# Initialize the SemanticSimilarityEvaluator
evaluator = SemanticSimilarityEvaluator()

# Define an async function to compute semantic similarity
async def compute_similarity(query_synopsis, reference_synopsis):
    # Use the SemanticSimilarityEvaluator to compute the semantic similarity score
    result = await evaluator.aevaluate(response=query_synopsis, reference=reference_synopsis)
    return result.score

# Compute semantic similarity scores for all animes
semantic_similarity_scores = np.array([compute_similarity(query_synopsis, reference_synopsis) for reference_synopsis in preprocessed_synopses])
```

## 4. Vector Database for Efficient Similarity Search

A vector database, like Faiss from Facebook AI or Annoy from Spotify, allows you to efficiently search for vectors that are most similar to a given query vector. These libraries use Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which is a method to find the points in a dataset that are closest to a given point, approximately. This is much faster than comparing the query to every single point in the dataset.

```python
from llama_index.vector_store import VectorStore

# Initialize the VectorStore
vector_store = VectorStore()

# Add the vectors to the VectorStore
for i, vector in enumerate(synopsis_vectors):
    vector_store.add_vector(i, vector)

# Define a function to get the top K most semantically similar animes
def get_semantic_recommendations(query_title, k=10):
    # Find the index of the query anime
    query_index = anime_data[anime_data['title'] == query_title].index[0]

    # Get the indices of the top K most semantically similar animes
    semantic_indices = vector_store.query(synopsis_vectors[query_index], top_k=k)

    return anime_data.iloc[semantic_indices]
```

## 5. Content-Based Filtering

For each categorical feature of the anime (like genre, director, etc.), we compute similarity scores between the query anime and all other animes. We might use techniques like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF followed by cosine similarity.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()
feature_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(anime_data['categorical_feature'])
feature_similarity = cosine_similarity(feature_matrix)
```

## 6. Combining Recommendations

Finally, we combine the recommendations from the semantic similarity and content-based filtering. We might simply take the union of the top K recommendations from each, or we could use a more sophisticated approach like rank fusion.

```python
def recommend_anime(query_title, k=10):
    # Find the index of the query anime
    query_index = anime_data[anime_data['title'] == query_title].index[0]

    # Compute semantic similarity
    semantic_indices = get_semantic_recommendations(query_title, k)

    # Compute content-based similarity
    content_indices = np.argsort(feature_similarity[query_index])[-k:]

    # Combine the recommendations
    combined_indices = np.union1d(semantic_indices, content_indices)

    return anime_data.iloc[combined_indices]
```

This is a more detailed version of the algorithm with a focus on the usage of LlamaIndex for semantic similarity and a vector database for efficient similarity search. There’s a lot of room for improvement.
