# uBlock Origin Guide

uBlock Origin is a powerful content blocker that helps users remove ads, tracking, and malware domains from their browsing experience. It is an efficient and lightweight extension that significantly improves web page load times and enhances privacy [uBlock Wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki).

## 1. Install uBlock Origin

Install the uBlock Origin browser extension for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Opera) from the [uBlock Origin website](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation).

## 2. Default Filter Lists

By default, uBlock Origin enables popular filter lists such as EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and URLHaus for blocking ads, tracking, and malware domains. Users can also import additional hosts files and community-maintained lists [EasyList.to](https://easylist.to/pages/policy.html).

## 3. Customize Filters

uBlock Origin supports dynamic filtering of scripts and iframes, and a webpage element hiding tool. Users can customize the filters to suit their browsing preferences [Dynamic Filtering](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-Benefits-of-blocking-3rd-party-script-and-iframe-tags).

## 4. Additional Features

uBlock Origin offers interface enhancements, privacy-oriented options, and site-specific switches to toggle blocking of pop-ups, strict domain blocking, cosmetic filtering, remote fonts, and JavaScript disabling. The Firefox version includes an extra feature to prevent websites from circumventing blockers [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki).
