## Redditors Notes

### Student Days

Advice from Reddit postings of random hero Redditors facing the same issues as grad school students: (When you're a student, you are your own boss).

1. **Focus on deliverables:** Set concrete tasks (deliverables) to complete each day to stay on track.

2. **Batch errands:** cram as many as possible together / minimize obligations at all costs

   - Group errands (laundry, emails, etc.) into a single day to minimize wasted energy.

3. **"Hard" days:** most productive / crucial

   - Sleep well the night before it.
   - Dedicate uninterrupted time for demanding tasks (writing papers, proving theorems).
   - Hack together a project / part of code / model design / experiment for solving the problem on hand.
   - Work until a checkpoint is reached to avoid losing progress.

4. **"Normal" days:**
    - Schedule tasks that require less focus (coding, reporting, writing results, meetings).
    - Tasks you know how to do, but "just have to get it done".

5. **"Relaxing" days:** Just as the word, emphasize Relaxing
    - Dedicate time for leisure activities (reading papers, socializing with colleagues).
      - i.e. sip some tea/coffee and read cool papers
      - socialize with the community and vibe it out.
    - Use this time to recharge and spark creativity.

6. **"Off" days:** Shutdown
    - Completely unplug and relax (video games, hobbies).

7. **Schedule daily routines:**
    - Allocate fixed time slots for exercise and leisure activities.

8. **Manage motivation:**
    - Prioritize tasks when motivated and switch to relaxing mode when lacking motivation.
    - Utilize "relaxing" days to recharge and maintain productivity.

9. **Plan daily goals:**
    - Set clear goals for the next day before going to bed.
    - Treat these goals as commitments you made to yourself.

10. **Be deliberate:**
    - Approach your day with intention:
      - At the beginning of the day set a "theme of the day" from the examples mentioned above.
    - Evaluate each activity before starting and write it down for accountability.

- **Remember:** Enjoy the flexibility of early career and set your own pace. However, prioritize deliberate action and motivation management for long-term success.

### **Transitioning to Industry:**

In the industry, expect a shift in your day-to-day:

- **Focus on supervisor's priorities:** While your own goals and capabilities remain important, your supervisor's expectations become a critical factor (sometimes aligning, sometimes not, with your own priorities).
- **Balance efficiency and progress:** Be prepared to churn out tasks efficiently while demonstrating significant progress on projects at any given moment.
- **Master time management:** Industry demands promptness with communication and other seemingly small tasks, requiring strong time management skills.

In essence, industry life often becomes a dance between "what needs to be done now?" and "what your brain is capable of today?" add "what my boss/supervisor wants you to do" to the mix... which sometimes, but not quite often, aligns with your first and/or second one.

***Don't overthink it - find a balance and keep moving forward.***
