# Flowers 102 Dataset Overview
---
## Introduction

The Flowers 102 dataset is a consistent set of images representing 102 different categories of flowers common to the UK. This dataset is often used for image classification tasks and research.

## Dataset Details

- **Number of Classes**: 102
- **Total Number of Images**: 8189
- **Images per Class**: Varies from 40 to 258
- **Size of Images**: All images are resized to 500x500 pixels most of them same range if not squared image.

## Class Distribution

The dataset has a varied distribution of images across classes. Some classes have as few as 40 images, while others have as many as 258 images.

## Data Split

The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The recommended split is:

- **Training Set**: 10 images per class
- **Validation Set**: 10 images per class
- **Test Set**: Remaining images

## Usage

This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks where the categories to be distinguished are very similar to each other.
