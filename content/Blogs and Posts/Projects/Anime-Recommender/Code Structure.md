# Basic Structure

## Overview

This project aims to build an anime recommendation system using LlamaIndex, a language model, and Streamlit. The system will recommend similar anime series based on semantic similarity of descriptions and categorical features.

## Code Structure

The project is divided into several parts, each contained in its own Python file:

1. **language_model.py**: This file contains the code for loading and using the language model. It uses the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to load a pre-trained model and compute embeddings for text.

    ```python
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

    class LanguageModel:
        def __init__(self, model_name):
            self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
            self.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

        def encode(self, text):
            input_ids = self.tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')
            embeddings = self.model(input_ids)[0].mean(1)
            return embeddings.detach().numpy()
    ````

2. **llama_index.py**: This file contains the code for indexing the anime data using LlamaIndex. It loads the data from a file, computes the embeddings of the anime descriptions using the language model, and adds the anime to the index.

    ```python
    from llama_index import LlamaIndex

    class AnimeIndex:
        def __init__(self, data_path, language_model):
            self.index = LlamaIndex()
            self.language_model = language_model
            self.load_data(data_path)

        def load_data(self, data_path):
        # Load your data from the CSV or Parquet file
        # For each anime, compute the embedding of its description using the language model
        # Add the anime to the index using its embedding and categorical features

        def query(self, text, k=10):
    # Compute the embedding of the query text using the language model
    # Query the index using the embedding and return the top k results
    ```

3. **recommender.py**: This file contains the code for the recommendation system. It uses the indexed data to generate recommendations based on the user’s input.

    ```python
    class Recommender:
        def __init__(self, anime_index):
            self.anime_index = anime_index

        def recommend(self, text, k=10):
            # Query the index using the text and return the top k results
    ```

4. **streamlit_app.py**: This file contains the code for the Streamlit app. It provides a user interface for the recommendation system.

    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    from src.recommendation.recommender import Recommender

    # Initialize your recommender
    recommender = Recommender()

    st.title('Anime Recommender')

    # Get user input
    text = st.text_input('Enter a description of an anime you like')

    if text:
        # Get recommendations
        recommendations = recommender.recommend(text)

        # Display recommendations
        for anime in recommendations:
            st.write(anime)
    ```

## Conclusion

Building a recommendation system is a complex task that requires a good understanding of both the data and the tools used. This project provides a basic structure for such a system, but it might need to be modified according to specific requirements and the actual structure of the data. Also, it’s important to handle exceptions and edge cases in the code to make it robust and reliable.
