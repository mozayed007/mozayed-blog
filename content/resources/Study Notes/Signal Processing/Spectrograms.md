# The Spectrogram and The Gabor Transform

## Summary

The Gabor transform is used to compute the spectrogram, which shows the frequency content and temporal information of a signal. It is useful for analyzing Brain Activity Signal, EEG, audio signals and classifying sounds.

## Gabor Transform

The Gabor transform of a signal ( **x(t)** ) is defined by this formula:

$$G_x(\tau, \omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-\pi (t-\tau)^2} e^{-j\omega t} dt$$

In this equation:

- ( ***x(t)*** ) is the signal to be transformed.
- The term : $$e^{-\pi (t-\tau)^2}$$represents a Gaussian window function, which gives higher weight to the signal near the time being analyzed.
- The term : $$e^{-j\omega t}$$ is the Fourier transform, which gives the frequency components of the signal.
- The integral over all time $$(-\infty)$$ to $$(\infty)$$ calculates the Fourier transform for each position of the Gaussian window, resulting in a time-frequency analysis.

## Highlights

- 🎵 **The Gabor transform** computes the spectrogram, showing frequency and temporal information of a signal.
- 🎹 **The Fourier transform** gives frequency components of a signal, but not their timing.
- 📊 **The Gabor transform** combines frequency and temporal information to create a time-frequency plot.
- 🌊 **The spectrogram** is useful for classifying sounds, analyzing data, and identifying features in audio signals.
- 🎶 **Shazam** uses the spectrogram to match peaks in the power spectrum with known songs.
- 🎸 **The spectrogram** can help classify instruments and even differentiate musicians based on their playing style.
- 🎹 **The spectrogram** of Beethoven’s sonata reveals the timing and intensity of each note.

## Key Insights

- 💡 The Fourier transform provides frequency information, while the Gabor transform combines frequency and temporal information in the spectrogram.
- 💡 The spectrogram is a valuable tool for analyzing audio signals, classifying sounds, and identifying features in data.
- 💡 Shazam uses the spectrogram to match peaks in the power spectrum with known songs, even accounting for speed variations.
- 💡 The spectrogram can be used to classify instruments and differentiate musicians based on playing styles.
- 💡 The Gabor transform and spectrogram allow us to visualize the timing and intensity of notes in musical compositions.
- 💡 The spectrogram is particularly useful for studying time-varying signals that are not perfectly periodic, like audio recordings.
