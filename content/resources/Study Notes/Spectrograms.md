# The Spectrogram and The Gabor Transform

## Summary

The Gabor transform is used to compute the spectrogram, which shows the frequency content and temporal information of a signal. It is useful for analyzing Brain Activity Signal, EEG, audio signals and classifying sounds.

## Gabor Transform

The Gabor transform of a signal ( **x(t)** ) is defined by this formula:

$$G_x(\tau, \omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-\pi (t-\tau)^2} e^{-j\omega t} dt$$

In this equation:

- ( ***x(t)*** ) is the signal to be transformed.
- The term : $$e^{-\pi (t-\tau)^2}$$represents a Gaussian window function, which gives higher weight to the signal near the time being analyzed.
- The term : $$e^{-j\omega t}$$ is the Fourier transform, which gives the frequency components of the signal.
- The integral over all time $$(-\infty)$$ to $$(\infty)$$ calculates the Fourier transform for each position of the Gaussian window, resulting in a time-frequency analysis.

## Highlights

- ðŸŽµ **The Gabor transform** computes the spectrogram, showing frequency and temporal information of a signal.
- ðŸŽ¹ **The Fourier transform** gives frequency components of a signal, but not their timing.
- ðŸ“Š **The Gabor transform** combines frequency and temporal information to create a time-frequency plot.
- ðŸŒŠ **The spectrogram** is useful for classifying sounds, analyzing data, and identifying features in audio signals.
- ðŸŽ¶ **Shazam** uses the spectrogram to match peaks in the power spectrum with known songs.
- ðŸŽ¸ **The spectrogram** can help classify instruments and even differentiate musicians based on their playing style.
- ðŸŽ¹ **The spectrogram** of Beethovenâ€™s sonata reveals the timing and intensity of each note.
